# Analysis

## Layer 1, Head 12

It seems like this attention head pays attention to adjectives and the nouns they are describing. For the first sentence, the diegram shows that 'green' refers to 'turtle'. For the second sentence, the diagram shows that 'red' refers to 'color'.

Example Sentences:
- The green turtle swam into the deep blue [MASK].
- Santa was dressed in a [MASK] of color red.

## Layer 5, Head 6

For this test, I choose two sentences with prepositions which work as an adjunct to a noun ('in March' and 'from France'). This head clearly shows in both cases, that the head learned about this relationship between the prepositions and their adjunct nouns.

Example Sentences:
- The weather in March is usually [MASK].
- Cheese from France is considered the [MASK].
